# Gshare Branch Predictor

This repository contains a SystemVerilog implementation of the gshare branch predictor, a dynamic branch prediction algorithm widely used in modern processor designs. The gshare predictor combines global branch history with the program counter using XOR-based indexing to access a Pattern History Table (PHT) of 128 2-bit saturating counters, enabling accurate prediction of conditional branch outcomes to minimize pipeline stalls. The implementation includes separate prediction and training interfaces to support speculative execution, a global history shift register that tracks recent branch outcomes and corrects itself on mispredictions, and supporting modules including a 2-bit saturating counter FSM with four states (Strongly Not Taken, Weakly Not Taken, Weakly Taken, Strongly Taken) and a countdown timer utility.
